# hwglabr
### Hochwagen lab R package

Compilation of functions written and used frequently by Hochwagen
lab members. Currently, this means functions used to analyse data from
ChIP-seq experiments: wiggle data produced by the lab's Fastq2Peak ChIP-seq
analysis pipeline.

This is a starting point for the development of a more
complete and useful package.

#### Listing included functions

In order to get the names of all included packages directly from within R just use the function **`ls()`**:
