Description: Compilation of functions written and used frequently by Hochwagen
    lab members. Currently, this means mostly functions used to analyse data from
    ChIP-seq experiments: wiggle data produced by the lab's Fastq2Peak ChIP-seq
    analysis pipeline. This is a starting point for the development of a more
    complete and useful package.
